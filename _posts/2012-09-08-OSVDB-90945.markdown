### OVSBD ID

* [OSVDB-90945](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/90945)


### GEM NAME

* loofah


### PATCHED VERSIONS


* `>=  0.4.6`


### DESCRIPTION

Loofah Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the
Loofah::HTML::Document\#text function passes properly sanitized
user-supplied input to the Loofah::XssFoliate and
Loofah::Helpers\#strip_tags functions which convert input back to
text. This may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted
request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser
within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
