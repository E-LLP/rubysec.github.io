### OVSBD ID

* [OSVDB-102129](http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/102129)


### GEM NAME

* echor


### PATCHED VERSIONS

None.

### DESCRIPTION

Echor Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in backplane.rb in the perform_request function that is triggered when a semi-colon (;) is injected into a username or password. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to inject arbitrary commands if the gem is used in a rails application.
