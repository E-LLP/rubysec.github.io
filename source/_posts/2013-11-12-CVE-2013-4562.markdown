### CVE ID

* [CVE-2013-4562](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/99693)



### OVSBD ID

* [OSVDB-99693](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/99693)


### GEM NAME

* omniauth-facebook


### PATCHED VERSIONS


* `>= 1.5.0`


### DESCRIPTION

omniauth-facebook Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as HTTP requests do not
require multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when
performing certain sensitive actions. By tricking a user into following
a specially crafted link, a context-dependent attacker can perform a
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack causing the victim to
perform an unspecified action.
