### OVSBD ID

* [OSVDB-90716](http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/90716)


### GEM NAME

* fileutils


### PATCHED VERSIONS

None.

### DESCRIPTION

fileutils Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the program not verifying the existence of a directory before attempting to create it. This may allow a local attacker to create the directory in advance, thus owning any files subsequently written to it.
