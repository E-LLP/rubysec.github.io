### OVSBD ID

* [OSVDB-90715](http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/90715)


### GEM NAME

* fileutils


### PATCHED VERSIONS

None.

### DESCRIPTION

fileutils Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as the program creates temporary files insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use a symlink attack against temporary files created by files_utils.rb to cause the program to unexpectedly overwrite an arbitrary file.
