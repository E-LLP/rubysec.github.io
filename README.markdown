This is a theme for the blogging framework [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) that was created with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

### Here is an example

<a href="http://brianarmstrong.org"><img src="https://github.com/barmstrong/octopress-bootstrap/raw/master/source/assets/screenshot.png"  alt="Octopress Bootstrap"/></a>

Since it just regular bootstrap you can of course modify the theme by using any bootstrap theme such as those from at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/) or [wrapbootstrap.com](http://wrapbootstrap.com/).
