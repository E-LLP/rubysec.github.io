  title: Spree Ruby Gem contains a flaw in the API
  date: 2015-03-05
  description: ! 'Spree contains a flaw in the API as HTTP requests do not require

    multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when

    performing certain sensitive actions. By tricking a user into

    following a specially crafted link, a context-dependent attacker

    can perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack

    causing the victim to disclose potentially sensitive information

    to attackers.
