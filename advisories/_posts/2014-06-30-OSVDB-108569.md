  title: Gain access to password information
  date: 2014-06-30
  description: backup_checksum Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in /lib/backup/cli/utility.rb
    that is triggered as the program displays password information in plaintext in
    the process list. This may allow a local attacker to gain access to password information.
