  title: Dragonfly Gem Remote Code Execution
  date: 2014-08-25
  description: ! 'Dragonfly Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in Uploading & Processing
    that is due

    to the gem failing to restrict arbitrary commands to imagemagicks convert.

    This may allow a remote attacker to gain read/write access to the filesystem

    and execute arbitrary commands.
