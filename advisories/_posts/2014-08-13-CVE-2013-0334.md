  date: 2014-08-13
  description: Bundler Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when handling
    a gemfile that contains multiple top-level source lines. This may allow a context-dependent
    attacker to install specially crafted gems on a remote system, leading to arbitrary
    code execution.
