  title: XSS Vulnerability in simple_format helper
  date: 2013-12-03
  description: "There is a vulnerability in the simple_format helper in Ruby on Rails.\nThe
    simple_format helper converts user supplied text into html text \nwhich is intended
    to be safe for display. A change made to the \nimplementation of this helper means
    that any user provided HTML \nattributes will not be escaped correctly. As a result
    of this error, \napplications which pass user-controlled data to be included as
    html \nattributes will be vulnerable to an XSS attack.\n"
