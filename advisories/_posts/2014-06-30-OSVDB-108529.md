  title: Gain access to password information as local attacker
  date: 2014-06-30
  description: kajam Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in /dataset/lib/dataset/database/postgresql.rb
    that is triggered as the program exposes the MySQL or PostgreSQL password in the
    process list. This may allow a local attacker to gain access to password information.
